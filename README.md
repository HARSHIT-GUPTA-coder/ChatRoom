# ChatRoom-
It's a very basic Android Chat App which uses Firebase Relative Database.
Includes a register and login functionality to create users in the database and log in to the app.
After logging in, the user will see a list of all the users. The list is not updated in real time but has to updated manually byb hitting the refresh button. Select a user to chat with and start chatting!!!(The chats are updated in real time. So no worries of hitting button everytime:).)
